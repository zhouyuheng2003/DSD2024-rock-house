## Introduction

The document reflects the consensus of teams on the modular division, defines how modules communicates with each other, providing a crucial basis of module design for developers and testers across teams.

The specifications in each section under the *New in version x.y* is added since this version. Lines starts with *Changed in version x.y* states how the specifications above this line changed in this version.

## Server calls Algorithm

The following files SHOULD be provided.

### `algo.json`

*New in version 2.0*

This file SHOULD describe all algorithms provided by the algorithm module in JSON format.

For example:

```
{
	"lstm": { # internal name, [a-z0-9]+(-[a-z0-9]+)*
		"name": "lstm", # same internal name
		"display": "LSTM", # displayed name
		"desc": "An algorithm that...", # displayed introduction
		"base": "$ALGO/lstm/base.h5", # default base model if not found in database
		"entrypoint": {
			# train program
			"train": ["/usr/bin/env", "python3", "$ALGO/lstm/train.py"],
			# predict program
			"predict": ["/usr/bin/env", "python3", "$ALGO/lstm/predict.py"]
		}
	},
	# ... more algorithms
}
```

`$ALGO` MAY be used as a variable containing the path pointing where the algorithm module is installed, without trailing slash.

Be noticed the comments above are for illustration only, may not be supported in production, so SHOULD be stripped.

### `motions.json`

This file SHOULD define all calibration motions required in JSON format.

For example:

```
[
    {
        "name": "walk", # internal name, [a-z]+
        "display": "Walk", # displayed name
        "desc": "Please walk on ...", # displayed introduction
        "duration": 20 # duration of recording requested
    },
    # ... more motions
]
```

*New in version 2.0*

Be noticed the comments above are for illustration only, may not be supported in production, so SHOULD be stripped.

### `requirements.txt`

*New in version 2.0*

This file SHOULD list all Python dependencies for algorithms.

### Base Model File

*New in version 2.0*

For each algorithm, a valid base model specified in `algo.json` SHOULD be provided.

### Train Programs

On the cloud platform, the server module SHOULD call a `train` entry point from `algo.json`, appending the following command-line arguments in order, to train various models.

- `data_dir`: Absolute path of a directory, with some `.csv` motion data files named with the motion recorded.
- `new_model`: Absolute path of a writable file containing the training outcome when finished.
- `base_model`: Absolute path of the model file used as the base of this training.

*Changed in version 2.0*: The program entry point is now provided in `algo.json`.

*Changed in version 2.0*: The CSV files SHOULD contain lines of samples from motion sensors. Each sample is one line of 45 comma-separated values.

*New in version 2.0*

The process SHOULD exit returning zero if the training was success, non-zero otherwise. If the process returns zero, the `new_model` SHOULD exist and be a replacement of the base model.

### Predict Program

On the embedded platform, the server module SHOULD call a `predict` entry point from `algo.json`, appending the following command-line arguments in order, to predict the user's motion.


- `model_file`: Absolute path of the model used for predicting

The sensor data SHOULD flow in to the `stdin`, one line of 45 comma-separated values each sample from motion sensors. The predicted result SHOULD flow out to `stdout`, one motion name each line.

*Changed in version 2.0*: One sample contains 45 values now.

*New in version 2.0*

The model file SHOULD be a training result, a administrator's upload, or the base model provided in `algo.json`.

The program SHOULD flush its output buffer for server to receive results in time.

## Server calls Database

### Sensor Interface

On the embedded platform, the database module provides sensor data sampling to the server module, then to the algorithm module.

The program `collect.py` SHOULD be called with no arguments. The data collected SHOULD be written directly to the `stdout`, one line of 45 comma-separated values for each sample from motion sensors.

*Changed in version 2.0*: One sample SHOULD contain 45 values now.

*New in version 2.0*

The program SHOULD flush its output buffer for server to receive samples in time.

### `db` Package

On the cloud platform, the server module calls the database modules to manage admin accounts, device models, device calibrations, device contact email etc. The database module SHOULD provide a package named `db`, with 2 modules `admin` and `device` in it.

*Changed in version 2.0*: The `db.model` module is now merged into the `db.device` module.

*New in version 2.0*

The database SHOULD be stored in the path where environment `DSD_DATABASE` points, or in the current working directory if the environment is not specified.

### `db.admin`

#### `db.admin.add(username: str, password: str) -> bool`

Add an administrator account with the specified username and password.

Database SHOULD check the strings to be non-empty and less than 40 characters, the username to contain only `[A-Za-z0-9_]`, and the password to contain only character greater than `0x1f` and less than `0x7f`. `ValueError` SHOULD be raised when the sanity check failed.

Returns `True` if succeed, `False` if the username existed.

#### `db.admin.check(username: str, password: str) -> bool`

Check if the given credential is a valid administrator account.

Returns `True` if the credential is valid, `False` otherwise.

#### `db.admin.remove(username: str) -> None`

Removes the administrator with the specified username.

Returns `None` always.

### `db.device`

The `devid` SHOULD always be a valid UUID.

*Changed in version 2.0*: The UUID SHOULD be of any version, **including** the Nil UUID.

*New in version 2.0*

The Nil UUID (all zero) is now a special value that SHOULD never be assigned to a device. Its models SHOULD be considered the fallback base models, other fields SHOULD be preserved for future use.

#### `db.device.exists(devid: Union[str, uuid.UUID]) -> bool`

*New in version 2.0*

Returns `True` if the device exists in the database, `False` otherwise.

#### `db.device.get(devid: Union[str, uuid.UUID]) -> db.device.Device`

Returns the `db.device.Device` object of the device with a specified device ID. The device entry SHOULD be created if not found.

#### `db.device.remove(devid: Union[str, uuid.UUID]) -> None`

Delete everything about the device with a specified device ID.

Returns `None` always.

### `db.device.Device`

*Changed in version 2.0*: The `db.device.Device.banned` is now deprecated.

#### `db.device.Device.id: uuid.UUID`

The ID of the device.

Read only property.

#### `db.device.Device.email: Optional[str]`

Defaults to `None`.

#### `db.device.Device.model[algo: str]: Optional[str]`

The path of the device's model file, if exists. SHOULD be an absolute path.

On assignment, SHOULD copy the file specified into the database. When `None` is assigned, SHOULD delete the corresponding model in the database.

Defaults to `None`.

*New in version 2.0*

The `algo` SHOULD be the an internal name of an algorithm, matching `[a-z0-9]+(-[a-z0-9]+)*`. Each device may have one model per algorithm.

#### `db.device.Device.calibration: Optional[str]`

The path of the device's calibration data directory, if exists, with some `.csv` motion data files named with the motion recorded. SHOULD be an absolute path.

On assignment, SHOULD copy the files in the directory specified into the database. When `None` is assigned, SHOULD delete the data.

Defaults to `None`.

### `db.model`

*Changed in version 2.0*: This module is deprecated. The base model SHOULD now be accessed by `db.device.get(uuid.UUID(int=0)).model[algo]`.

## Interaction calls Server

The server module provides API in RESTful style to the interaction module. The cloud and device API SHOULD be provided via HTTPS from two different Origin.

*Changed in version 2.0*: The cloud API now base in `/api/` to ease the deployment with the interaction module.

### Cloud Authentication

All cloud interfaces, excluding the authentication ones, requires a device ticket or an administrator session. If no valid authentication presents, all these API SHOULD return a `401 Unauthorized`.

#### Device Ticket Authentication

The device ticket SHOULD be created by signing a cloud-signed timestamp with the device key, which is signed by the cloud key at the factory. 

Send `GET /api/timestamp` to request a cloud-signed timestamp, consisting colon-separated Unix timestamp and a server signature. For example,

```
1650375337:6bce5953a9506d6c14f2522fd6228afbee394da3
```

Send the timestamp to device's `GET /ticket?ts=` to request the device ticket, consisting colon-separated cloud-signed timestamp, device signature for the timestamp, and device certificate from factory. For example,

```
1650375337:6bce5953a9506d6c14f2522fd6228afbee394da3:e2a29754a9c9d894748edaa3fa1175e126b4b7f58afa541fe7b58def3b298f2d800670c67300aea3bdcdd06db90d8a8830e0cee47e70f04a71e3edfda67ccb8c:c4bc95299b8ff4226399fb33d8b33608ecb31db281b579898292703a9509690b:038d03270d6cdb4b339758923654349e23eb8af21ccd0558690458bcdfae08655ec6e8a32728e4dbb7cffa3a623c54fc41d7d2eb8b0dccd41a79334d9d572d03
```

The interaction module SHOULD send the ticket in the `Authorization` header for cloud API to authenticate devices.

Please note the signed timestamp is valid for only 1 hour. Device ticket with a timestamp issued more than 1 hour ago SHOULD be considered invalid.

#### Administrator Authentication

Send `POST /api/session` to log in a session as an administrator. The request SHOULD be of type `application/json`. For example,

```
{
    "username": "UserName",
    "password": "PaSSw0Rd!"
}
```

A new session will be set, and `200 OK` is returned if logged in successfully, `403 Forbidden` otherwise.

Send `DELETE /api/session` to log out, returns `200 OK` always.
